# Scenario 1 - Bank Loan

## Context
You're a team of Junior Data Scientists working at *La société agricole* bank.  
Individuals can request a loan from *La société agricole*. The request will be manually reviewed by a risk expert who will determine if the loan is accepted or refused. This process is very slow.  
*La société agricole* aims to increase customer satisfaction. Reducing response time for loan request seems a great way to go.  
To do this, your team is asked by the top management to use Data Science to automatise the decision process for loan request.  
You're expected to present your results to top management and risk experts in two weeks.


## Notes on the project
- Very close to what we have done during the workshop.
- Ok ~11/20 -- Good ~12/20 -- Excellent ~13.5/20
- Team of 3 max. 
- If you accept a loan request then take it back, the client will really not be satisfied.
