# Scenario 2 - Crypto Trading

## Context
You're the founders of *Crypto Puppy Investments*, a FinTech startup.  
Your business plan is to sell buy/sell indicators on cryptocurrencies trough memberships.  

For example, we can imagine that each day at 8:00 UTC you provide to your subscribers the following :
 - BTC : buy
 - ETH : hold
 - APE : sell

Obviously, your goal is to provide the best indicators as possible. Nobody, would subscribe to a service that makes them lose money. To do this, you decide to use Data Science to develop the best indicators.  
You're expected to present your business plan and argument the quality of your indicators in two weeks to a panel of investors to raise money.


## Notes on the project
- OK 16/20 -- Good 18/20 -- Excellent 20/20
- It's by far the trickiest scenario !
- You  can freely change of business model, most startup do it anyway. This scenario is just about doing something valuable with crypto data.
- You're dealing heavily with Time-Serie data - BE CAREFUL !
- Don't focus on trading strategy : a 2-SMA strategy is perfectly fine for this project.
- Focus on data collection, data cleaning and validation.
- Don't rush into time-serie forecasting blindly.
- Your users don't want a technical indicator, they want to know what to do to make money.
