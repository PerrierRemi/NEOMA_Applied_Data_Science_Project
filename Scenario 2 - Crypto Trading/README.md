# Scenario 2 - Crypto Trading

## Context
You're the founders of *Crypto Puppy Investments* (aka CPI), a FinTech startup.  
Your business plan is to sell buy/sell indicators on cryptocurrencies trough memberships.  

For example, we can imagine that each day at 8:00 UTC you provide to your subscribers the following :
 - BTC : buy
 - ETH : hold
 - APE : sell

Obviously, your goal is to provide the best indicators as possible. Nobody, would subscribe to a service that makes them lose money. To do this, you decide to use Data Science to develop the best indicators.  
You're expected to present your business plan and argument the quality of your indicators in two weeks to a panel of investors to raise money.


## Notes on the project
- It's by far the trickiest scenario !
    - OK 16/20 -- Good 18/20 -- Excellent 20/20
- If you want to change your business plan, please go ahead ! Most startup update their business model when they gain domain knowledge.
- You're dealing heavily with Time-Serie data - BE CAREFUL !
- Thanks to gas fees even if you're sure that price will go up today you can lose money by buying ! So don't rush into time-serie forecasting blindly.
