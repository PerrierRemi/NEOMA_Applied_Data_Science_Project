- Deadline : 21/0/2022

- By group of 2, 3 or 4 (~10 groups).
    - Except Scenario 1 which is limited to 2 or 3 persons.

- Send me an email with your team composition and your subject.

- You should :
    - Prepare a 10m presentation with slides (expect some questions).
        - Slides in English.
        - Presentation in French or English (Bonus point if you go with English !)
        - Your presentation should underline the business value created by your solution.
        - Your presentation must be comprehensible for non-technical people but also show the technical quality of your work (you'll probably need to explain some key technical concepts to your audience).
    - Create a GitHub repository and upload all your code.

- There are 3 subjects :
    - Scenario 1 is really easy so expectations will be higher.
    - Scenario 2 and 3 are really open, be creative, grades will be more generous for them.

- You can come up with your own subject.
    - Precise it within your email with your team composition.

- You will be evaluated on :
    - Communication quality (presentation, vulgarization and answers to questions). 
    - Technical quality (methodology / code quality)
    - Business added value and relevance.
